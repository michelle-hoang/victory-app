              At the start of Stackathon, I (a naive and bright-eyed soul)
              ambitiously set out to make a heat map of crime in Chicago using
              d3.js. <br />
              <br /> d3.js is also known as "Data-Driven Documents" or the
              Javascript Library that Satan would make, if he was a data
              scientist.
